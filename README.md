# Reliable File Transfer System over RUDP

## Overview

This project introduces a robust file transfer system built on Reliable UDP (RUDP), enhanced with custom implementations of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System) functionalities. Designed to combine UDP's efficiency with TCP-like reliability, our system ensures fast and reliable file transfers, dynamic IP address allocation, and effective domain name resolution.

## Reliable UDP (RUDP) Protocol

RUDP adds reliability features to UDP transmissions, including sequence numbering for packet order and integrity, acknowledgments (ACKs) for received packets, retransmission of lost packets, and control mechanisms for flow and congestion. This protocol serves as the foundation of our file transfer system, ensuring data integrity and delivery without the overhead of TCP.

### Features

- **Sequence Numbers & ACKs**: Guarantees data order and confirms packet delivery.
- **Retransmission**: Lost packets are automatically resent based on missing ACKs.
- **Flow & Congestion Control**: Dynamically adjusts transmission rate to network conditions.

## DHCP Implementation

Our system includes a DHCP server for dynamic IP address allocation. This feature automatically assigns IP addresses to client devices, managing network configurations without manual setup.

### DHCP Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Clients broadcast a discovery message to identify available DHCP servers.
2. **Offer**: The DHCP server offers an IP address to the client.
3. **Request**: The client requests the offered IP address.
4. **Acknowledgment**: The server assigns the IP address to the client and sends an acknowledgment.

## DNS Functionality

The DNS component allows clients to resolve domain names into IP addresses, facilitating connections to the server using human-readable names rather than numeric IP addresses.

### DNS Process

1. **Query**: A client sends a query to the DNS server with the domain name.
2. **Lookup**: The DNS server looks up the domain name in its records.
3. **Response**: The server responds with the corresponding IP address.

## Usage

Detailed instructions on starting the server, running clients, and utilizing DHCP and DNS functionalities are provided in separate documentation files within the project repository.

## Conclusion

Our file transfer system showcases the potential of combining traditional protocols with modern enhancements to achieve high efficiency and reliability in data transmission. By integrating RUDP, DHCP, and DNS into a cohesive system, we address the complexities of network communications, offering a streamlined solution for file transfers.
